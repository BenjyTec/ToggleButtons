#ToggleButtons

This library adds two custom widgets that adhere to the Material Design definition for toggle buttons.  

When no text is present they will use a custom draw that allows proper image alignment.  When text is present they will behave like a traditional CompoundButton (ToggleButton).  You can toggle exclusive selection on a group and you can also allow unselecting (no selection at all).  Buttons support tint.  

Library is currently API 21+, but can be ported to 11+ (possibly 7 or 9).
